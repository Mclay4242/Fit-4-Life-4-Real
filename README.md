Okay, so I have two major issues that have stopped me from going forward:

1. I can not seem to connect my CSS files to my views pages. Every time I try to implement them it crashes the page or won't show up at all.

2. I can not figure out how to access the login credentials from the database. I know that using jason web token is probably needed, but I am having a hard time with get/post requests and however I access the fields on the page.
